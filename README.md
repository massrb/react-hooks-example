# Sample React App

### Page load is delayed using a higher order component

### A timer is displayed at the top which represents seconds since the page loaded
This timer is never reset

### Another timer is rendered using the same component that renders the first timer. 
This timer can be reset or stoped. There is an increment and decrement button to
change the displayed count. If the count changes from a number to zero or passes between
positive and negative then the this timer will reset. The count can also be incremented or decremented 
by more than one by selecting from the drop down. Whenever that selection changes then the this timer resets.
The timer at the top never resets.
